# ieso-api

Ontario's IESO has public records on zonal and overall demand, supply, and pricing of power consumption and generation in Ontario, stored in .csv and .xml formats, but accessing this data manually can be time-consuming. 

This script will serve as an API to get and read this public data, and serialize it into JSON for personal interest and potential use.
